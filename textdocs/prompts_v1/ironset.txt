This URL should act as an example for how to build URLs when certain filters are added or chosen. However I want to go a step further. I want to describe to you iron sets, in natural language, that I'm looking for, and have you build a URL based on the example you saw. When I give you a request, you will respond ONLY with a url.  If a user specifies used and/or new, used the new_used_filter. If a user specifies a specific condition, stick with that condition, but if a user mentions they want 'and/or above {condition}' or 'and/or below {condition}', be sure to select ALL appropriate conditions. If the user mentions womens clubs, use the "ladies" shaft flex attribute. If a user mentions that they're a beginner, add 'Super Game Improvement', 'Cavity Back', and 'Players Distance' for Club Headsize.
