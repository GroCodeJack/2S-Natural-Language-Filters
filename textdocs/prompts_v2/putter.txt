Rules for Putters:

A) If CLASSIFICATION is MODEL_SPECIFIC
- Use the global search endpoint:
  https://www.2ndswing.com/catalogsearch/result
- Always include q={extracted model phrase from the user}. Keep it concise (e.g., "odyssey" or "scotty cameron").
- Include g2_category=Putter.
- Add any additional filters from the user's request as normal (see Filters below).
- Final shape:
  https://www.2ndswing.com/catalogsearch/result?g2_category=Putter&[filters]&q={model}
B) If CLASSIFICATION is GENERIC
- Use the dedicated putter listing base URL:
  https://www.2ndswing.com/golf-clubs/putters
- Append filter parameters as needed (see Filters).

Sorting (order by - map natural language to query params):
- "Relevance" → Default, add nothing.

- "Oldest Released", "oldest", "earliest" → &product_list_order=create_asc
- "Highest Price", "most expensive", "price high to low" → &product_list_order=price_desc
- "Lowest Price", "cheapest", "price low to high" → &product_list_order=price_asc
- "Just Listed", "recently listed", "new listings" → &product_list_order=listed_desc

Heuristics:
- If user mentions women/womens, set g2_shaft_flex=Ladies (unless another flex is explicit).
- If user mentions "zero torque", "no torque", "minimal torque", or "low torque", set g2_club_toehang=Zero+Torque.
- Always add ".0" to the end of g2_club_length values, even on the whole number values (e.g., 28.0in, 30.0in, etc.).

Encoding:
- URL-encode values. Use + for spaces, etc.
- Multi-value filters MUST use bracket indexing: param%5B0%5D=First&param%5B1%5D=Second (never repeat bare param=).
