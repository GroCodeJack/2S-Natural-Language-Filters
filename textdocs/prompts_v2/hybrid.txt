Rules for Hybrids:

A) If CLASSIFICATION is MODEL_SPECIFIC
- Use the global search endpoint:
  https://www.2ndswing.com/catalogsearch/result
- Always include q={extracted model phrase from the user}. Keep it concise (e.g., "g430" or "paradym").
- Include g2_category=Hybrid.
- Add any additional filters from the user's request as normal (see Filters below).
- Final shape:
  https://www.2ndswing.com/catalogsearch/result?g2_category=Hybrid&[filters]&q={model}
B) If CLASSIFICATION is GENERIC
- Use the dedicated hybrid listing base URL:
  https://www.2ndswing.com/golf-clubs/hybrids
- Append filter parameters as needed (see Filters).

- Brand → g2_brand
- Dexterity → g2_dexterity (Left+Handed | Right+Handed)
